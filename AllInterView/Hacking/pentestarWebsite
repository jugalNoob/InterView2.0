The concept of internet layers refers to the layered architecture of network protocols used to facilitate communication over the internet. This architecture is typically described by models such as the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model and the TCP/IP model. Each layer has a specific function and communicates with the layers directly above and below it. Hereâ€™s an overview of these layers:

OSI Model (7 Layers)
Physical Layer:

Function: Transmits raw bitstreams over a physical medium (e.g., cables, radio waves).
Examples: Ethernet cables, fiber optics, Wi-Fi.
Data Link Layer:

Function: Handles node-to-node data transfer, error detection, and correction.
Examples: Ethernet, MAC addresses, switches.
Network Layer:

Function: Manages logical addressing and routing of data packets between devices.
Examples: IP (Internet Protocol), routers.
Transport Layer:

Function: Ensures reliable data transfer, flow control, and error handling between end systems.
Examples: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
Session Layer:

Function: Manages sessions and controls connections between applications.
Examples: NetBIOS, RPC (Remote Procedure Call).
Presentation Layer:

Function: Translates data between the application layer and the network, including encryption and compression.
Examples: SSL/TLS, JPEG, ASCII.
Application Layer:

Function: Provides network services directly to end-user applications.
Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS.
TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)
Link Layer (Network Interface Layer):

Function: Combines OSI's Physical and Data Link layers. Handles hardware addressing and media access control.
Examples: Ethernet, ARP (Address Resolution Protocol).
Internet Layer:

Function: Corresponds to OSI's Network layer. Manages logical addressing and routing.
Examples: IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol).
Transport Layer:

Function: Corresponds to OSI's Transport layer. Ensures data transfer reliability.
Examples: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
Application Layer:

Function: Corresponds to OSI's Session, Presentation, and Application layers. Provides network services to applications.
Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS.
