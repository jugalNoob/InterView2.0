1. Applied AI
Organizations gain easy access to machine learning (ML), computer vision, and natural language processing (NLP). By 2030,
using AI will be the expected cost of business. Python, PyTorch, and TensorFlow will continue to be high-demand tech skills.


2. Zero latency connectivity
By 2030, expect lightning-fast internet, essential for AI demands. Wireless low-power networks, 6G cellular, Wi-Fi 6 
and 7, low-Earth orbit satellites, and more. While it won’t technically be “zero latency”, it will be as close as it can get.

3. ACES Vehicles
Autonomous, connected, electric, and shared vehicles (ACES) will be the norm. The road is quite literally 
clear for it, with cutting-edge AI for smarter vehicles, faster internet, superior sensor technology, increased 
investment in green technology, and maturing regulatory guidelines. 

4. Biotechnology boom
Breakthroughs in AI will translate to a boom in biology, allowing organizations to respond to demands in healthcare, 
food and agriculture, consumer products, sustainability, and energy and material production. Molecular biology and gene
therapy will also be areas of development.

5. Climate change mitigation technology
According to the World Economic Forum, 45% of organizations expect to adopt mitigation technology in the next five years.
Expect renewable energies, drought resistant crops, early warning systems, sustainable fuels, electric vehicles, carbon
removal tech, and sea walls.

6. Quantum computing
Quantum technology long-promised delivery is finally coming, and will be highly disruptive when it lands. Far more efficient
than classical computers, quantum tech will be able to run solutions and solve problems that will lead to major advancements
in aerospace, automotive, chemicals, finance, pharmaceuticals, and more.

7. Cloud and edge computing
Edge computing will be used to allow processing of data closer to their origins (ultra-low latency), achieve data
sovereignty, and enhanced data privacy, reducing data transmission delays and costs. Expect more hyperscale remote
data centers and cloud services than ever.

8. Immersive reality technology
Venture capitalists have been pumping billions of dollars into Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Mixed Reality (MR) 
startups every year, with a vast amount of patents for these technologies. A desire to combine these technologies with remote work 
will likely lead to advancements in this space.

9. Digital-trust technologies and cybersecurity AI
Zero-trust architectures (ZTAs), digital-identity systems, and privacy engineering will be of paramount importance. With the rise
of AI and its ability to be used by bad actors, “Cybersecurity or Die” will become the norm, with both defenders and attackers
increasingly leaning on AI.

10. Low and no-code software development
A combination of AI pair programmers, low to no code platforms, infrastructure as code, automated integration, and generative
AI tools will transform software development as we know it, particularly as these software tools mature.

10 technologies that will likely emerge by 2030
The above list are well researched trends, and dare we say, somewhat “safe”. Here are some bigger predictions that could 
eventuate based on research. 

1. Instant, Multimodal AI Avatars
Imagine conversing seamlessly with a digital AI avatar that responds instantly with visual and auditory feedback (and all
you have to do is have your webcam on). Building on our current AI capabilities of processing audio, visual, and text inputs, 
these advanced multimodal (and perhaps omnimodal) avatars will represent a pinnacle of efficiency.

2. Adaptive Predictive Artificial Intelligence (APAI)
APAI could revolutionize efficiency: autonomously streamlining supply chains, preempting patient health
issues with targeted interventions, managing energy grids smartly, maximizing agricultural yields, and
forecasting consumer behaviors. It's not just predictive; it's proactively transformative.

3. Lab grown food
Advancements in biotechnology and a desire for climate change mitigation may lead to strides in commercially 
available lab-grown food. According to Oxford, cultivated meat could be produced with 96% less greenhouse emissions
and 96% lower water use.

4. Commercially viable DNA storage
Synthetic DNA has enormous potential due to high storage density, but the high cost and slow read/write times are a
barrier to adoption. However, in the last three years we’ve seen a custom DNA writer that can write data to DNA at 
18 Mbps. We may see jumps in this space by 2030.

5. AI-powered brain-computer interfaces
Brain computer interface (BCIs) research has been picking up this decade, with DARPA funding BCI technology
through the BRAIN initiative since 2013, and Musk throwing his hat in the ring with Neuralink. There are public
perception, ethical, and legislative barriers here, but the use of AI in conjunction with BCIs may advance this technology at a rapid pace between now and 2030.

6. Better batteries
Improving batteries has always been hampered by slow experimentation and discovery processes. AI is currently
being used to advance battery development and make this process faster. There’s also a drive for this so we have
more efficient electric vehicle batteries, a must if cars all go towards an ACES direction.

7. Improved weather prediction AI
As our climate changes, the need to predict disasters will become paramount. In 2023, scientists at the University
of Texas created an AI tool that could predict earthquakes with 70% accuracy a week in advance. Expect this technology
y to mature in the next decade.


8. Preventative medicine
With strides in AI, doctors may be empowered to predict a patient’s health issues far in advance. Preventative 
action will be more common, and likely encouraged by governments and health insurance providers to avoid costly 
treatments further down the line.

9. Real time linguistic translation
Think Google Glass, but translating other languages that you are staring at or hearing in real time. We already have
AI technology where you can take a photo with your phone and translate text, but this will be a step up from that. This 
would be a massive benefit not only for tourists, but for business interactions in different countries.

10. Adaptive PII detection
One of the biggest issues with AI use is when people put in personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive information
in it. With adaptive PII detection, this would be nipped in the bud before it becomes a problem, which is of benefit to both the
user and the service providers.
