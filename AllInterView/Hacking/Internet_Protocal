1:: What is MAC address?

MAC --> Media Access Control Address

Mac Address Example 

0A:22:84:D5:65:V4
0A:22:84:                                    D5:65:V4
Organization Unique Identifier   ----        Network interFace Controller
0::manufactur
1::Country  --> 0A                             1::is called devic Id
2::State --> 22
3::City and manufactur -->84


Ans: address only use  hexadecimal number 0-9 A-F meaning is 0-15

ANs::Command check  getmac

website --> mac lookup -->check  mac address https://macaddress.io/mac-address-lookup/72jpGEZXkB

||||||||| Types of internet Protcol  ------------------------>>

1::Ip4

2::Ip6

3::Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable and ordered delivery of data packets between devices on a network

4::User Datagram Protocol (UDP): UDP is a connectionless protocol that provides a lightweight mechanism for data transmission.

5::Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP): HTTP is a protocol used for transferring hypertext documents (web pages) on the World Wide Web.

6::Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS):HTTPS is an extension of HTTP that adds a layer of security through encryption using SSL/TLS protocols.

7::File Transfer Protocol (FTP): FTP  FTP is a protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server on a network
7:::File Transfer Protocol Secure (FTPS): An extension of FTP that adds encryption for secure file transfer.

8::Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP): SMTP is a protocol used for sending email messages between servers.


9::Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3): A protocol for retrieving email messages from a mail server.

10::Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP): A protocol for accessing email messages stored on a mail server.

11::Domain Name System (DNS): A protocol that translates domain names into IP addresses, enabling users to access websites using human-readable names.

12::Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP): A protocol used to dynamically assign IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network.

13::Address Resolution Protocol (ARP): A protocol used to map IP addresses to physical MAC addresses on a local network.

14::Border Gateway Protocol (BGP): A protocol used to exchange routing information between autonomous systems on the internet.

15::Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP): A protocol used for monitoring and managing network devices and their functions.

17::Secure Shell (SSH): A protocol for secure remote login and command execution on networked devices.

18::Telnet: A protocol for remote terminal access and control over a network.

19::Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP): A protocol used for error reporting and diagnostic functions in IP networks.

20::Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP): A protocol used for managing multicast group membership in IP networks.

1::Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS): MPLS is a protocol-agnostic routing technique that directs data from one network node to the next based on short path labels rather than long 

2::Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN): VXLAN is a tunneling protocol used to extend Layer 2 segments over Layer 3 networks, enabling the creation of large-scale virtualized networks in data centers.

3::Open Shortest Path First version 3 (OSPFv3): OSPFv3 is an advanced version of the OSPF routing protocol that supports IPv6 and allows for the efficient routing of IPv6 traffic in large-scale networks.

4::Border Gateway Protocol version 4 (BGPv4+): BGPv4+ is an enhanced version of the Border Gateway Protocol used for inter-domain routing on the internet. 

5::Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD): BFD is a network protocol used to quickly detect and report failures in bidirectional communication links

6::Network Time Protocol (NTP): NTP is a protocol used to synchronize the clocks of computers and network devices over a network, ensuring accurate timekeeping and coordination of distributed systems.

7::Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) / Transport Layer Security (TLS): SSL and TLS are cryptographic protocols used to secure communications over a computer network. They provide encryption, authentication, and data integrity for protocols like HTTPS, SMTPS, and FTPS.

8::Internet Protocol Security (IPsec): IPsec is a suite of protocols used to secure IP communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet

9::Session Initiation Protocol (SIP): SIP is a signaling protocol used for initiating, maintaining, and terminating real-time sessions, such as voice and video calls, over IP networks.\

10::Quality of Service (QoS) protocols: Various QoS protocols, such as Differentiated Services (DiffServ) and Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP), 

11::irtual Private Network (VPN) protocols: VPN protocols like Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP), and Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) are used to create secure, encrypted tunnels over public networks, allowing remote users to access private networks securely.

IPv4 Address: This is the most widely used type of IP address. It consists of 32 bits and is expressed in the form
of four decimal numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

IPv6 Address: With the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses, IPv6 was introduced to provide a much larger address space.
IPv6 addresses are 128 bits in length and are represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons
(e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

Public IP Address: A public IP address is assigned to a device by the Internet Service Provider (ISP) and is accessible over the
internet. It uniquely identifies the device on the internet.

Private IP Address: Private IP addresses are used within a private network, such as a home or office network. These addresses 
are not directly accessible from the internet. They are used for communication within the local network and are typically
assigned by a router using DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).


Static IP Address: A static IP address is assigned to a device and remains constant over time. It does not change unless manually
reconfigured. Static IP addresses are often used for servers or network devices that require consistent accessibility.


Dynamic IP Address: A dynamic IP address is assigned to a device by a DHCP server and may change over time. Each time
the device connects to the network, it may be assigned a different IP address from the available pool of addresses. 
This is common in home networks and is more cost-effective for ISPs since they can allocate IP addresses dynamically as needed.
