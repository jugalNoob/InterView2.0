QPorts
Definition: A port is a virtual point where network connections start and end. Ports are used by network protocols to
identify specific processes or services on a device.

Port Numbers: Ports are identified by numbers ranging from 0 to 65535. They are divided into three categories:

Well-Known Ports (0-1023): These ports are reserved for common services and protocols. Examples include:
HTTP: Port 80
HTTPS: Port 443

IP (Internet Protocol) and ports are fundamental concepts in computer networking, but they serve different purposes and functions. Here's a detailed comparison between the two:

Internet Protocol (IP):
1. Definition:

IP is a set of rules for routing and addressing packets of data so they can travel across networks and arrive at the correct destination. It defines how data is sent from one computer to another over the internet.
2. Function:

Addressing: IP assigns unique addresses to each device on a network, known as IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1 for IPv4 or 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 for IPv6).
Routing: IP determines the best path for data to travel across interconnected networks to reach its destination.
3. Types of IP:

IPv4: Uses 32-bit addresses, allowing for about 4.3 billion unique addresses.
IPv6: Uses 128-bit addresses, allowing for a virtually unlimited number of unique addresses.
4. Layer:

IP operates at the Network Layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model.
5. Examples:

IPv4 Address: 192.168.0.1
IPv6 Address: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
Ports:
1. Definition:

Ports are logical endpoints for network communications, used to identify specific processes or services on a device. Each port is associated with a specific IP address, and together they form a unique connection point.
2. Function:

Service Differentiation: Ports allow a single IP address to support multiple types of network services. For example, a web server and an email server can run on the same IP address but use different ports.
Communication: Ports help manage multiple simultaneous connections and direct the data to the correct application or process.
3. Types of Ports:

Well-Known Ports (0-1023): Reserved for common services (e.g., HTTP on port 80, HTTPS on port 443).
Registered Ports (1024-49151): Assigned to specific services upon request (e.g., Microsoft SQL Server on port 1433).
Dynamic/Private Ports (49152-65535): Used for temporary or private connections, often dynamically assigned by the operating system.
4. Layer:

Ports operate at the Transport Layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model.
5. Examples:

HTTP: Uses port 80
HTTPS: Uses port 443
SSH: Uses port 22
Key Differences:
1. Purpose:

IP: Identifies devices on a network and routes data between them.
Ports: Identify specific services or processes on a device and direct network traffic to the appropriate application.
2. Scope:

IP: Addresses entire devices or interfaces.
Ports: Addresses specific applications or services on a device.
3. Uniqueness:

IP: Each device or interface on a network must have a unique IP address.
Ports: Ports are used in conjunction with IP addresses. A device can have many ports, and the combination of an IP address and port number forms a unique endpoint.
4. Representation:

IP: Represented as a series of numbers (IPv4) or hexadecimal characters (IPv6).
Ports: Represented as a 16-bit number (e.g., 80, 443, 8080).
5. Layer in OSI Model:

IP: Operates at the Network Layer (Layer 3).
Ports: Operate at the Transport Layer (Layer 4).
Example Scenario:
When you visit a website (e.g., http://example.com), your computer:

Uses IP: Your computer sends a request to the IP address of the web server hosting the website.
Uses Ports: The request is sent to port 80 on the web server (default port for HTTP). If it's a secure connection (https://example.com), the request is sent to port 443.
