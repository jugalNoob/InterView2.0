Q::What is WiFi?
Ans::WiFi stands for Wireless Fidelity. It's a technology that allows electronic devices
to exchange data wirelessly over a computer network,
including high-speed internet connections.


Q How does WiFi work?
Ans WiFi works by using radio frequency signals to transmit data between devices.
A WiFi-enabled device, such as a computer, smartphone, or router, uses a wireless adapter 
to translate data into a radio signal. This signal is then transmitted 
over specific frequencies to other WiFi-enabled devices within range.


Q Types of WiFi networks:
:: Ans 802.11 Standards: WiFi networks operate based on IEEE 802.11 standards, with different versions offering
various speeds and features. Common standards include 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n,
802.11ac, and 802.11ax (also known as WiFi 6).

:: Frequency Bands: WiFi operates on two primary frequency bands: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. The 2.4 GHz
band offers better range but is more susceptible to interference, while the 5 GHz band provides faster 
speeds but has a shorter range.


Q Components of a WiFi network:

:: Router: The router is a device that manages traffic between devices on a local network and 
connects to the internet. It typically includes a wireless access point for WiFi connections.

:: Wireless Access Point (WAP): This device allows wireless devices to connect 
to a wired network using WiFi. In home networks, the router often includes a built-in wireless access point.

:: Wireless Adapter: Found in devices like computers, smartphones, and tablets, a wireless adapter 
enables them to connect to WiFi networks.


Q  WiFi Security:
:: Encryption: WiFi networks can be secured using encryption protocols like WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2)
or WPA3, which scramble data transmitted between devices to prevent unauthorized access.


:: Passwords: Access to a WiFi network is typically protected by a password, which users must enter to connect.
It's important to use strong, unique passwords to prevent unauthorized access.


Q WiFi Range:

:: The range of a WiFi network depends on factors like the power of the router, environmental 
conditions, and obstacles (walls, furniture, etc.). Range extenders or mesh WiFi systems can 
be used to extend coverage in larger homes or buildings.


Q WiFi Standards Evolution:

:: WiFi technology continues to evolve with each new generation of standards, offering faster speeds, better
range, and improved performance. WiFi 6 (802.11ax) is the latest standard (as of my last update), offering
significant improvements over previous versions in crowded environments
and supporting more devices simultaneously.
