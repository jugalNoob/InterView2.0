-----------What is Cookies  ??? )))<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Q what is cookies ?

An: 1 --> Web browser

2: track , Personalize and save Information 

3: user session 

4: Cookies

5::Set-Cookie

6::Hijacking And Poisoning


Q what is Cookies Attributes ??

Ans::Name: The name of the cookie. It is a mandatory attribute and uniquely identifies the cookie.

Value: The value stored in the cookie. It is also mandatory and holds the data the cookie is meant to store.

Domain: Specifies the domain for which the cookie is valid. The cookie will be sent to this domain and its subdomains.

Path: Defines the URL path that must exist in the requested resource before sending the cookie. It limits the scope of the cookie to a specific path within the domain.

Expires/Max-Age:

Expires: Sets the expiry date and time for the cookie. After this time, the cookie
 will be deleted by the browser. This attribute uses a specific date format.

Max-Age: Specifies the maximum lifetime of the cookie in seconds. After this duration,
 the cookie will be deleted.

Secure: When set, the cookie will only be sent over secure (HTTPS) connections.
 It ensures the cookie is encrypted during transmission, enhancing security.

HttpOnly: When set, the cookie is inaccessible to JavaScript's Document.cookie
 API, helping mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

SameSite:

Strict: The cookie is sent only to the same site as the one that originated it, 
even when following a link to that site.

Lax: The cookie is sent when the user navigates to the cookie's origin site
 (e.g., following a link from an external site), but not with cross-site subrequests (e.g., loading images or frames).

None: The cookie is sent in all contexts, i.e., in responses to both
 first-party and cross-origin requests. If None is used, the Secure attribute must also be set.

Priority: Defines the priority of the cookie (Low, Medium, High). This attribute is useful 
in environments with limited space for cookies.
