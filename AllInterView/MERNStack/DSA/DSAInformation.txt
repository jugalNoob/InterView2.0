::::::::::::::: ALGO   

......Searching Algorithms:
Linear Search: Iterates through a list to find a target value.
Binary Search: Searches a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.



.....Sorting Algorithms:
::Bubble sort 
::Merge sort
::Quick Sort
::selection Sort
::insert sort


......Dynamic Programming:
Fibonacci Sequence:::: Solves the Fibonacci sequence efficiently using dynamic 
programming to avoid redundant calculations.

Knapsack Problem::: Finds the most valuable combination of items that fit into
a knapsack of limited capacity.


.....String Algorithms:
String Matching Algorithms (e.g., Knuth-Morris-Pratt, Boyer-Moore): Finds occurrences 
of a pattern within a text.

Longest Common Subsequence: Finds the longest subsequence present in
given two sequences of characters.


...Backtracking:
N-Queens Problem::: Finds all possible configurations of placing N queens
on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Sudoku Solver::: Solves Sudoku puzzles by placing digits from 1 to 9 in
a 9×9 grid while satisfying the constraints.



1:::::::::: Data  Data structures are essential components in computer science and programming. :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

...Array: A collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations, each
identified by an index. Arrays can be one-dimensional, multi-dimensional, or jagged

....Linked List: A data structure consisting of a sequence of elements where each element points to the next 
one in the sequence.

...Stack: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure where elements are added and removed from the same end, 
called the top. It follows the principle of "last in, first out."

....Queue: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from
the front. It follows the principle of "first in, first out."

....Tree: A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. Trees have a root
node, parent nodes, and child nodes. Types of trees include binary 
trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and red-black trees.


...Graph: A non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect these nodes.
Graphs can be directed or undirected and may have weighted or unweighted edges.

...Hash Table: A data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type,
where data is stored in key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index
into an array where the desired value can be found.


....Heap: A special type of tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap 
property. Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues.



...Trie: Also known as a prefix tree, it is a tree data structure used to store a dynamic
set of strings where each node represents a common prefix of its descendants.



....Graphs: Data structures representing networks consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges
(connections). Graphs can be directed or undirected, cyclic or acyclic, and weighted or unweighted.
